# ZEMZEVoptimalBarrier

working PoC of ZEM/ZEV-based, fuel optimal, collision avoidance and planetary landing algorithm

### UPDATE: 29-09-2022 ###

- testable code with multiple barrier shapes
- the constant l4 can be adjusted on case-by-case basis to avoid going through the barrier
- negative l4 may allow the trajectory to come back inside
- works against all possible cases
